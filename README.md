    About stdlib...
  </summary>
  <p>We believe in a future in which the web is a preferred environment for numerical computation. To help realize this future, we've built stdlib. stdlib is a standard library, with an emphasis on numerical and scientific computation, written in JavaScript (and C) for execution in browsers and in Node.js.</p>
  <p>The library is fully decomposable, being architected in such a way that you can swap out and mix and match APIs and functionality to cater to your exact preferences and use cases.</p>
  <p>When you use stdlib, you can be absolutely certain that you are using the most thorough, rigorous, well-written, studied, documented, tested, measured, and high-quality code out there.</p>
  <p>To join us in bringing numerical computing to the web, get started by checking us out on <a href="https://github.com/stdlib-js/stdlib">GitHub</a>, and please consider <a href="https://opencollective.com/stdlib">financially supporting stdlib</a>. We greatly appreciate your continued support!</p>

## Usage

```javascript
import indexOf from 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/stdlib-js/array-base-index-of@deno/mod.js';
```

#### indexOf( x, searchElement, fromIndex, equalNaNs )

Returns the index of the first element which equals a provided search element.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ];

var idx = indexOf( x, 3, 0, false );
// returns 2
```

If the function is unable to find an element which equals a provided search element, the function returns `-1`.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 ];

var idx = indexOf( x, 7, 0, false );
// returns -1
```

To begin searching from specific index, provide a non-zero `fromIndex` argument.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3 ];

var idx = indexOf( x, 2, 3, false );
// returns 4
```

If `fromIndex` is less than zero, the starting index is resolved relative to the last array element, with the last array element corresponding to `fromIndex = -1`.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 3 ];

var idx = indexOf( x, 2, -4, false );
// returns 4
```

When searching for a search element, the function checks for strict equality. As a consequence, `NaN` values are considered distinct. In order to resolve the first element which is `NaN`, set the `equalNaNs` argument to `true`.

```javascript
var x = [ 1, 2, 3, NaN, 5, 6 ];

var idx = indexOf( x, NaN, 0, false );
// returns -1

idx = indexOf( x, NaN, 0, true );
// returns 3
```

<section class="notes">

## Notes

-   If provided an array-like object having an `indexOf` method and `equalNaNs` is `false`, the function defers execution to that method and assumes that the method API has the following signature:

    ```text
    x.indexOf( searchElement, fromIndex )
    ```

-   If provided an array-like object without an `indexOf` method or if `equalNaNs` is `true`, the function performs a linear scan and returns immediately upon finding a match.

idx = indexOf( x, 'foo', 1, false );
